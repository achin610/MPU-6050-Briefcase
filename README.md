# MPU-6050-Briefcase
The following code was intended for the GY521-MPU6050 Gyroscope and accelorometer. It was created in Arduino has supporting code that
provides visual feedback in processing. The code requires three libraries, two of which that needed to be downloaded separately. The 
first one that is built into Arduino is the Wire.h library. The other two that need to be downloaded include the I2Cdev as well as the 
MPU6050 libraries using the following link. https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino.

Once the code imported with the correct libraries and the circuit assembled properly, there should be no issues uploading and running the
code.
